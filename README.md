# Forest Cover Type Classification Model

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts forest cover type (tree species / land cover categories) based on cartographic features such as elevation, slope, soil type, and wilderness area.

# Project Overview

Goal: Classify forest cover types from environmental and geographical data.

Dataset: Forest Cover Type dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle).

Algorithms Used:

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Conclusion: Random Forest achieved higher accuracy than XGBoost on this dataset, making it the preferred model.

# Features
